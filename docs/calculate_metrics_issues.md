If you don't use the command `tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token`, the following can happen:

### 1. **Error When Padding is Required**:
   Many models expect a `pad_token_id` when dealing with padding, especially when sequences are of different lengths (e.g., during batching). If the tokenizer does not have a `pad_token` defined, you may encounter errors or unexpected behavior when the model tries to handle padding during inference or training.

   - **Default Behavior**: If `pad_token` is not defined, the tokenizer and model may use the `eos_token_id` (end-of-sequence token) for padding, which can sometimes lead to incorrect behavior, like the model treating padding tokens as meaningful tokens during generation or evaluation.

### 2. **Padding Token Misuse**:
   The `pad_token` is intended to ensure sequences are properly padded to the same length when processing a batch of sequences. Without a specific `pad_token`, the model might use a token from the vocabulary that could interfere with the intended behavior, especially for models with specific padding strategies. 

   By explicitly setting `tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token`, you're instructing the model to use the end-of-sequence token for padding, which is fine in some cases (like when the model does not have a dedicated padding token), but it's not ideal for all situations, particularly if the padding token interferes with the model's expected behavior.

### 3. **Inference or Training Issues**:
   - When generating text, a model may stop when it encounters the `eos_token`. If this token is used for padding, the model could prematurely end the generation, as it might think the sequence has finished.
   - Similarly, during training, padding tokens help the model ignore padded values. If `pad_token` is not set explicitly, the model might not be able to handle padding correctly, potentially leading to issues when calculating loss or attention.

### When Should You Set `pad_token = eos_token`?
   This approach is usually acceptable when:
   - The model does not have a dedicated `pad_token` (some models like GPT-2 and its variants don't have one by default).
   - You're fine with the model treating padding tokens as the end of the sequence, which can be fine in some contexts like text generation, but it may not work well for tasks like sequence classification.

### Best Practice
If you're working with models that don't explicitly have a `pad_token`, setting `pad_token = eos_token` ensures compatibility, but it's always better to check whether your specific model has a defined padding token, and use a unique `pad_token` if possible.

If the model was trained with a specific padding token, ensure to use the same padding token to avoid issues in loss calculation or text generation. For example:

```python
# If a model has a specific padding token
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.pad_token or tokenizer.eos_token
```

This ensures that if the model has a predefined padding token, it will be used; otherwise, it falls back to using the `eos_token`.
