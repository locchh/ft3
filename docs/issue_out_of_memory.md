The error you're encountering is a `CUDA out of memory` issue. This occurs when PyTorch tries to allocate more memory than is available on your GPU. In this case, PyTorch attempted to allocate 64 GiB of memory, which exceeds your GPU's available capacity of 23.87 GiB. Here's how you can fix or mitigate this issue:

### 1. **Reduce Tensor Size**:
   If possible, reduce the size of `causal_mask` by decreasing `sequence_length` or `target_length`. These are the dimensions of the tensor that is causing the memory allocation error. Reducing these parameters should help reduce the memory required for the tensor.

   Example:
   ```python
   causal_mask = torch.full((sequence_length // 2, target_length // 2), fill_value=min_dtype, dtype=dtype, device=device)
   ```

### 2. **Use `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`**:
   Sometimes memory isn't released properly, leading to fragmentation. You can explicitly release unused memory by calling `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`:

   ```python
   torch.cuda.empty_cache()
   ```

   Place it after your tensor allocations to ensure that memory is freed before the next allocation.

### 3. **Enable Gradient Checkpointing**:
   If you're training a model, enabling **gradient checkpointing** can reduce memory consumption by not storing all intermediate activations for backpropagation. This will allow you to save memory at the cost of extra computation.

   Example:
   ```python
   model = model.to(device)
   model = torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint_sequential(model, segments=2)
   ```

### 4. **Adjust `max_split_size_mb` for Fragmentation**:
   You can adjust the `max_split_size_mb` configuration to avoid fragmentation, which might help when memory is reserved but not fully allocated:

   ```bash
   export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:128
   ```

   You can experiment with different values for `max_split_size_mb` to find the most effective configuration.

### 5. **Use Mixed Precision Training**:
   Using **mixed precision** can significantly reduce memory usage by using 16-bit precision (half-precision) instead of 32-bit precision. You can use PyTorch's `torch.cuda.amp` for mixed precision training.

   Example:
   ```python
   scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()
   with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
       output = model(input)
       loss = loss_fn(output, target)
   ```

### 6. **Use CPU Instead of GPU (if necessary)**:
   If the model is too large for your GPU and none of the above suggestions work, consider using the CPU instead of the GPU for that particular operation (if it's feasible).

   Example:
   ```python
   causal_mask = torch.full((sequence_length, target_length), fill_value=min_dtype, dtype=dtype, device='cpu')
   ```

### 7. **Reduce Batch Size**:
   If you're training a model and the batch size is large, reducing it will directly reduce the memory required for the tensors.

   Example:
   ```python
   batch_size = 8  # Try reducing this to a smaller value
   ```

By implementing these suggestions, you should be able to reduce the memory usage and avoid running into `OutOfMemoryError`.
